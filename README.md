*How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
One of the best ways to interpret user needs is to understand what the end user will use the product for, or what the client wants it to do.
Then, you take those wants, and translate them into user stories with clear defined goals with testable conditions.
Now that you have assessed the goals of your program, you can begin to structure the program/project

*How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
When developing programs I take my goals or user stories and break them up into segments.
After that, I will typically write psuedocode to determine how I want t ostructure the program an dif=dentify what functions to write.
Next, I write all of the modular and indipendently testable aspects of the program
Then, I will pu tthe pieces together and finish writing the program.
Lastly, I test all the aspect of the program and attmpt to break or overload input and operations, and fix any bugs that appear.

*What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in software developement has a lot of similar characteristics as a typical team.
Good communication, transparency, honsty, dedication, hard work.
More specific to software developement are things like completing sprint goals, participating in team events like daily stand-ups, and delivering quality ethical software.
